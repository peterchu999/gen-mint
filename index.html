          Gumbo World is an IP-focused project that was introduced over a year
          ago. It's a story that follows your ordinary gumbo, just getting along
          on their daily life. Gumbo World features 3333 hand-picked Gumbos, all
          of which will have the potential for their IP to grow. We plan to
          build and truly turn this into a prominent IP through products,
          partnerships, social media traction and more. We are not your ordinary
          project. We're here to establish gumbo domination, and have our
          holders be alongside us every step of the way.

          Gumbo World IP was introduced over a year ago. Since then, we've
          received a lot of love and support from close friends. To show our
          appreciation to them, we've given them the ability to mint 5 NFTs at a
          very slight discount.
